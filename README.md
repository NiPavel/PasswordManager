# PasswordManager

Computer app that has done in the C#.NET as studying project in the Cyber Security course. In this project I have built a Password Manager.  I have used a Firebase Data Base to store an Info. 
To use the app user has to register, after registration/enter to the app user can store his passwords in the programm. In this project I used incription/decription to hide the passwords. If user want to see the real password that he stored so he can decripte the password, but he hast to approve that he is he. So the programm will send to him a mail with authintication key, if key is right programm will show him the real password. Also he can enter from the programm to the other prigramms/sites with real passwords that had decripted already.

To Run the programm you have to install the Visual Studio, copy all files and runt them.
